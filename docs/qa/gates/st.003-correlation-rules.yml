gate: PASS
status_reason: "All correlation rules implemented and unit-tested: AC-05/06/07/09/13 validated; 28/28 tests passing. Queue fallback requires reversed endpoints; unknown Invocation defaulting emits warnings; best-effort behavior confirmed."

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pure in-memory correlation processing; read-only operations; no sensitive mutations."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Forward-only scan; O(n^2) worst-case; acceptable for expected session sizes. Optimize if needed after profiling."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Determinism validated via unit tests; forward-only pairing; warnings do not fail status."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Contracts and schema documented; helper methods and unit tests codify expectations."

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - "Add diagnostics for ambiguous Queue matches and correlation confidence."
    - "Evaluate performance on large sessions; optimize scanning if necessary."
    - "Re-validate after ST-004 (loop detection) and ST-005 (output/dedup) to ensure interplay remains correct."
